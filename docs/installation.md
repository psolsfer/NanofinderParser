# Installation

----

## Stable release

To install NanofinderParser, run this command in your terminal:

=== ":simple-poetry: Poetry (recommended)"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    poetry add nanofinderparser
    ```

    If you donâ€™t have [Poetry] installed, you can refer to the following instructions for [Poetry installation].

=== "pip"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    pip install nanofinderparser
    ```

    If you don't have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can guide
    you through the process.

These are the preferred methods to install NanofinderParser, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
